# Synchrotron-Stress-Analysis
The available Matlab script and functions extract the stress state from synchrotron diffraction patterns (Debye-Scherrer rings) using the sin2(psi)-method.

The file "stress_evaluation_sin2psi.m" is the main file for the analysis, the remaining functions are called within this script.

The analysis is built upon the results from segment-wise integration of diffraction patterns conducted using the free software DPDAK (https://confluence.desy.de/display/DPDAK).

A more detailed explanation of the demanded input data and how the script works is given in the header lines of the main file.

Note: 
---
The script is not written for optimised performance, so feel free to modify as needed. Also feel free to add functionality to the code.

Contact information is provided in the header of each file, so feel free to use it if you have any questions.
